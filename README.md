# Hi there, I'm Abdelrahman! 👋

I’m currently navigating the **Master 2 in Machine Learning & AI (MIND)** at **Sorbonne Université**. 

I like digging into data to find answers to the important questions in life, like **"Where should I hide during an apocalypse?"** (Yes, I actually built a pipeline for that).

---

## 🧐 What I'm actually doing (besides surviving the apocalypse)
I bridge the gap between heavy math and real-world deployment. I’ve worked on everything from low-level memory management in C to high-level NLP models.

## 🧪 The Data Lab (AI & ML)

### 🧟‍♂️ The Survival Guide: Where to hide during an Apocalypse? (2025)
> *Because you can't fight zombies without good data.*
* **The Mission:** Built an end-to-end data science pipeline to mathematically determine the best location to survive a global collapse.
* **The Tech:** Full pipeline from problem framing to deployment.

### 🧠 DIY Neural Network (2025)
> *Why import `torch` when you can build it?*
* **The Mission:** Implemented a Neural Network from scratch, inspired by the early logic of PyTorch, to understand the raw math behind the magic.

### 🎲 Explainable Board Game Recommender (2025)
> *No more fighting over what to play next.*
* **The Mission:** Constructed a recommendation system using a database of reviews from a specialized board game website.
* **Focus:** Explainability telling the user *why* they would like the game.

### 🗣️ NLP: Politics & Cinema (2024)
> *Analyzing words that change the world (and movie tickets).*
* **The Mission:** Developed NLP models for two distinct tasks:
    1.  Distinguishing between political quotes.
    2.  Sentiment analysis of movie reviews.

## 🛠️ The Engineering Workshop (Systems & Web)

### 💾 Git-Inception: Version Control in C (2023)
> *I used Git to build Git.*
* **The Mission:** A "Git-like" version control software written purely in **C**.
* **The Code:** Handles file manipulation via Work Trees, commit management, and versioning systems under the hood.

### 🌐 Full-Stack Forum (2024)
> *Bringing people together, async.*
* **The Mission:** Developed a fully functional forum application.
* **The Stack:** JavaScript, Node.js, React, Express, and MongoDB.

### 🦁 Ecosystems: The Simulation (2022)
> *Survival of the fittest, coded twice.*
* **The Mission:** Simulated two biological ecosystems complete with prey and predators.
* **The Twist:** Implemented the simulation twice—once in **Java** and once in **C**—to compare performance and logic.

### 🔧 The Toolkit

**Languages:** Python , SQL, Java, C, JavaScript (React/Node).

**The Data Stack:** PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Spark, Docker, Ansible.

**Human Languages:** 🇺🇸 English (Fluent) · 🇫🇷 French (Fluent) · 🇪🇬 Arabic (Native) · 🇪🇸 Spanish (Beginner).

---

### ⚡ Lightning Round
* **Leadership:** I served as President of the SGMI Association, managing a team of 25+ people (I promise I didn't let the power go to my head).
* **Advocacy:** I was a Student Representative at Sorbonne, bridging the gap between students and faculty.
* **Current Quest:** I am actively looking for a **Master's Internship** in Data Science / AI starting **February 2026**.
