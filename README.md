# Hi there, I'm Abdelrahman! 👋

I’m currently navigating the **Master 2 in Machine Learning & AI (MIND)** at **Sorbonne Université**. 

I like digging into data to find answers to the important questions in life, like **"Where should I hide during an apocalypse?"** (Yes, I actually built a pipeline for that).

---

### 🧐 What I'm actually doing (besides surviving the apocalypse)
While my academic focus is on advanced Machine Learning, I believe that to truly master AI, one must understand the underlying systems that power it. This is why my portfolio is a hybrid of **Data Science** (constructing pipelines, NLP, and predictive modeling) and **Systems Engineering** (building low-level tools in C and Java).

Whether I am optimizing SQL queries for large-scale customer databases at **E&** or working on cloud infrastructure at **Orange**, my goal is always the same: to build robust, reproducible, and explainable solutions. The projects below represent my journey in bridging the gap between abstract algorithms and real-world application.

### 🧪 The Data Lab (AI & ML)

**🧟‍♂️ The Apocalypse Survival Guide**
> `Python` `Data Pipeline` `Deployment`
> An end-to-end data science pipeline designed to answer a critical question: *Where is the statistically best place to survive a global collapse?* From problem framing to final model deployment.

**🧠 DIY Neural Network**
> `Python` `NumPy` `Math`
> Implementation of a Neural Network from scratch without using Deep Learning libraries. Inspired by early versions of PyTorch to understand the raw calculus behind backpropagation.

**🎲 Explainable Board Game Recommender**
> `Data Science` `Explainable AI`
> A recommendation engine built on a database of board game reviews. Focuses on "Explainability"—telling the user *why* a specific game was suggested based on feature engineering.

**🗣️ NLP: Politics & Cinema**
> `NLP` `Sentiment Analysis`
> Developed models for two distinct tasks: distinguishing between political quotes and analyzing sentiment in movie reviews.

---

### 🛠️ The Engineering Workshop (Systems & Web)

**💾 Git-Inception: Version Control in C**
> `C` `Systems Programming` `Algorithms`
> A "Git-like" version control software written purely in C. It handles file manipulation via Work Trees, commit management, and versioning systems under the hood.

**🌐 Full-Stack Forum**
> `React` `Node.js` `MongoDB` `Express`
> A fully functional discussion platform. Handles user authentication, posts, and real-time updates using the MERN stack.

**🦁 Ecosystems: The Simulation**
> `Java` `C` `Simulation`
> A biological simulation of prey and predators. I implemented the exact same logic twice—once in **Java** and once in **C**—to benchmark performance differences between the languages.

---

### 🔧 The Toolkit

**Languages:** Python , SQL, Java, C, JavaScript (React/Node).

**The Data Stack:** PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Spark, Docker, Ansible.

**Human Languages:** 🇺🇸 English (Fluent) · 🇫🇷 French (Fluent) · 🇪🇬 Arabic (Native) · 🇪🇸 Spanish (Beginner).

---

### ⚡ Lightning Round
* **Leadership:** I served as President of the SGMI Association, managing a team of 25+ people (I promise I didn't let the power go to my head).
* **Advocacy:** I was a Student Representative at Sorbonne, bridging the gap between students and faculty.
* **Current Quest:** I am actively looking for a **Master's Internship** in Data Science / AI starting **February 2026**.
